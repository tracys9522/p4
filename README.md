Tracy:
- I have implemented a general framework of classes and main file

Need to finish:
- sort job queue by arrival
- page.cpp (not bad)
- process.cpp (not bad)
- paging algo (this is very easy. One person can just do all of them)
- main.cpp (more complicated, might need assistance)

Letty: I made some updates in process.cpp and page.cpp
